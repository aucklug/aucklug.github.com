  <h3>Meetings &amp; Events</h3>

  <p>AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, usually on the evening of the
  first weeknight of every month. These meetings are usually
  quite informal but often feature guest speakers on a Linux or
  Free/Open Source related subject, a meeting of minds and some
  light refreshments. Details of meetings can be found <a href=
  "http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2" target=
  "_new">here</a> (pre April 2012, link broken) or on our
  <a href="meetings.html">meetings page</a>.</p>
