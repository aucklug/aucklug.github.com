  <h1>About Auckland LUG</h1>

  <p>The Auckland Linux Users Group was formed in June 2005 as a
  spinoff of the long-standing <a href=
  "http://www.linux.net.nz">New Zealand Linux Users Group</a>.
  Historically, whilst other parts of New Zealand have had their
  own <a href="http://www.linux.net.nz/node/view/11">regional
  LUGs</a>, Aucklanders tended to just occupy the NZLUG Mailing
  list. (This in itself is a spinoff of the fact that when NZLUG
  was formed, it had a core membership of Aucklanders who used to
  regularly meet at one of their homes. Obviously, it is slightly
  bigger now :))</p>

  <p>Over time it seemed that in certain corners a 'NZLUG is
  mainly Aucklanders' reputation was built. This was of course
  not the case but - well - there was nothing in existance to
  prove it wrong :-)</p>

  <p>It was additionally realised by the people who regularly
  attend Auckland based NZLUG meetings that there would be
  definate advantages in a 'local' group, if only to serve for
  better coordination of local events and a more 'local
  community' feel.</p>

  <p>So in full cooperation with NZLUG, AuckLUG was formed. And
  here we are.</p>

  <h1>What does AuckLUG do? What does it stand for?</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Raise the profile of Linux in Auckland.</li>

    <li>Be the recognised champions of Linux in Auckland</li>

    <li>Help make Linux and Linux related software available to
    Aucklanders.</li>

    <li>Provide, in cooperation with NZLUG and other NZ regional
    LUGs, a resource for Linux users in Auckland and/or links to
    other resources.</li>

    <li>To provide a user group with active, friendly members
    able to welcome and provide assistance to people entering the
    Linux world, as well as thos who've been playing with it for
    a while.</li>

    <li>To hold regular meetings and work to provide linux
    related events in the Auckland area.</li>
  </ul><br>
  AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, Until April 2012 these were
  usually held on the evening of the First Monday of every month.
  After April 2012 the routine has changed; meetings will now
  fall on the first weeknight of every month (making the meeting
  more accessible to folks for whom Mondays were a problem).
  Details of the next meeting will be posted to AuckLUG, to
  NZLUG-Announce, and to <a href="meetings.html">our Meetings
  page</a> in the days leading up to the meeting. Through
  AuckLUG, Aucklanders have been (and will continue to be) active
  in Linux Expos and Installfests in the Auckland region,
  carrying on the legacy that NZLUG'rs have left in the years
  previously.

  <h1>What else is happening?</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>The mailing list, which forms the core of the AuckLUG,
    was hosted by Linux.net.nz until December 2011, at which time
    a server meltdown disrupted service. Today a <a href=
    "https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug">Google Group</a>
    hosts Auckland LUG discussiosn.</li>

    <li>The Website, which you're currently looking at, is a
    pretty basic way of getting core information out to the
    world. We also contribute to the <a href=
    "http://wiki.linux.net.nz">New Zealand Linux Wiki</a> and
    encourage others to do the same; This was built on the
    excellent resource that <a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz">the
    Waikato Linux Users Group</a> created as their own website.
    The power in a Wiki is of course, in getting as many people
    as possible involved.</li>

    <li>For information on our next meeting, you can join our
    mailing list (click the link to the group above, and then
    choose the 'join' link - or directly send an email to
    aucklug+subscrbe [at] googlegroups (dot) com), or subscribe
    to <a href=
    "http://www.linux.net.nz/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nzlug-announce">
    NZLUG-Announce</a>[currently offline], a low volume reflector
    carrying mainly event announcements for Linux Users Groups
    around NZ. Obviously joining our mailing list is best, but we
    recognise that some people don't necessarily want the mail
    volume associated with an open discussion forum. Also note
    that AuckLUG has a digest mode option, providing a collation
    of messages every day or so.</li>

    <li>Historical Meeting data will hopefully return to <a href=
    "http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2">http://www.linux.net.nz</a>,
    but for coming events check out <a href="meetings.html">the
    meetings page</a>.</li>

    <li>For the record, as of September 2010 AuckLUG has 277
    mailing list subscribers.</li>

    <li>An <b><a href="aup.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a></b>
    has been promulgated - to hopefully clarify the expected
    standards of behavior on the list. These are based on
    standard "netiquette" but members and guests - particularly
    if you're new to the LUG or to the mailing list concept - are
    invited to take a look.</li>
  </ul>
