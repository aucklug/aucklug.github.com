title: Changes in 2012

  <p>In December 2011 the Auckland LUG suffered from a server
  failure on the part of <a href=
  "http://www.linux.net.nz">Linux.net.nz</a> - who had been
  hosting AuckLUG's mailing list since it first established, and
  also hosted information about AuckLUG Events. Auckland LUG
  discussions moved to a temporarily-reformed-NZLUG Mailing list
  (hosted by the NZOSS) for several months. At the meeting of the
  Auckalnd LUG held on 2 April 2012 a whole raft of the issues
  facing Auckland LUG (in terms of where-to-from-here) were
  tabled for discussion. In the aftermath of this meeting a few
  changes were made.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Auckland LUG Mailing List was moved to <a href=
    "https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug">Google Groups</a>.
    This was in a desire to move the LUG core over to a 'cloud'
    environment that didn't become dependent on a single person
    and allowed for multiple folks to manage it over time.
    Several other options were tabled and (for the moment)
    discarded.</li>

    <li>The Mailing List Membership Database was rebuilt by Mark
    Foster and Nic Bellamy based on the last recoverable backup
    of linux.net.nz, plus all sub/unsub events logged subsequent.
    So it should be pretty complete. Glen ported this complete
    list to Google Groups.</li>

    <li>Meetings. Status quo for many years has been that the LUG
    meets on the 'First Monday of the Month'. Several members
    can't regularly make meetings on Monday nights for various
    reasons, so it was opted to move meetings to 'The First
    Working Day of the Month'. This will be a Monday on average 3
    meetings out of 7, but allow folks who cannot make Monday
    meetings to attend at least some of our meetings.</li>

    <li>Meetings will happen monthly and <b>will</b> include
    December and January (these have often been skipped due to
    the holiday season). However these may be more social type
    meetings, with dinner etc.</li>

    <li>Food. The Venue will try to organise Tea &amp; Coffee for
    meetings.</li>

    <li>RSVP. An optional RSVP for meetings would be helpful for
    the venue (for capacity planning) and is to be
    investigated.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The summary as posted to the LUG by Glen Ogilvie in the
  aftermath of the meeting can be viewed in the <a href=
  "https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug/browse_thread/thread/a82fae78e2d4ed56?hl=en-GB#">
  List Archive</a>.</p>

  <p>This website (hosted by <a href=
  "http://www.blakjak.net">Mark Foster</a> remains in place as a
  basic-but-functional web presence. We also continue to
  encourage the use of the <a href="http://wiki.linux.net.nz">NZ
  Linux Wiki</a> as a technical resource. No further group
  decisions have been made about the website specifically (as
  yet) but it was agreed that meeting announcements should be
  more widely published (Social Networking, etc). In the end,
  Auckland LUG is about the local community and the meetings and
  mailing list are the two focal points of this.</p>

  <p>Mark is working on some adjustments to this website to let
  us both publicise upcoming meetings, and archive details of
  past meetings along with any presentation materials. For the
  moment this is a work-in-progress but you can contact him (hit
  his website above, then then Contact link - or just send him an
  email if you know his address) if you have any questions or
  suggestions.</p>
