    <dd>Time to harden up - SELinux is no longer an option</dd>

    <dt>Presenter:</dt>

    <dt>Start Time:</dt>

      <p>SELinux has been in the mainline kernel since 2003 yet
      still many system administrators build systems with SELinux
      turned off. With many of the recent Enterprise Linux
      releases we are now at a point where fully enabled SELinux
      should be the norm.</p>

      <p>The purpose of this session is to demystify SELinux and
      show some of the tools now available to tweak and tune
      without compromising the security features SELinux
      offers.</p>

      <p>Steven has been involved in Open Source for over 20
      years, and a Linux user for over 15 years. Since moving to
      New Zealand he has provided technical direction and
      operational guidance for a number of New Zealand companies
      on the use of Open Source and Linux. His experience has
      included over 3 years running the the Linux operations team
      at IBM NZ, and the development of myPVR a MythTV based PVR
      solution designed for the New Zealand Market. He now works
      for Red Hat as a Solution Architect for NZ focusing on Red
      Hat Enterprise Linux and their Virtualisation products.</p>
