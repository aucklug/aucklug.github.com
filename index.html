  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p><strong>Auckland LUG arrangements have changed! For
  happenings in late 2011 and early 2012, please <a href=
  "changes2012.html">look here</a>. :-)</strong></p>

  <p>The Auckland Linux Users Group is a community of Linux
  enthusiasts from Auckland, New Zealand. Our mission is to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Raise the profile of Linux in Auckland.</li>

    <li>Be the recognised champions of Linux in Auckland</li>

    <li>Help make Linux and Linux related software available to
    Aucklanders.</li>

    <li>Provide, in cooperation with NZLUG and other NZ regional
    LUGs, a resource for Linux users in Auckland and/or links to
    other resources.</li>

    <li>To provide a user group with active, friendly members
    able to welcome and provide assistance to people entering the
    Linux world, as well as those who've been playing with it for
    a while.</li>

    <li>To hold regular meetings and work to provide linux
    related events in the Auckland area.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Auckland LUG was 'forked' from the New Zealand Linux
  Users Group (NZLUG) in 2005. The NZLUG and Auckland LUG have
  been active in Auckland since 1998, and have been seen at many
  IT and Free/Open Source Events across the region over the
  years.</p>

  <p>We look forward to continuing to support Aucklanders and
  show them the power, flexibility and freedom that Linux
  provides their computer experience. On this website you'll find
  information about the LUG, it's people and events, and pointers
  to many useful resources.</p>

  <h3>Meetings &amp; Events</h3>

  <p>AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, usually on the evening of the
  first weeknight of every month. These meetings are usually
  quite informal but often feature guest speakers on a Linux or
  Free/Open Source related subject, a meeting of minds and some
  light refreshments. Details of meetings can be found <a href=
  "http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2" target=
  "_new">here</a> (pre April 2012, link broken) or on our
  <a href="meetings.html">meetings page</a>.</p>

  <h3>Contact &amp; Membership</h3>

  <p>The Group is primarily active by way of an email <a href=
  "https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug">Mailing List</a>
  hosted by Google Groups. Several volunteers work in the
  background, moderating the list and maintaining the LUG's
  online resources - here's how to <a href=
  "/contact.html">contact them</a>.</p>

  <h3>Website Updates</h3>

  <p>This edition of the website is a much-needed update to the
  <a href="http://auckland.linux.net.nz/old">old site</a> which
  was well overdue for attention. However, this page is in itself
  a holding page while we evaluate what Auckland LUG'rs would
  like to see of their website. Dynamic content? Online
  discussions? News? Nows your chance to have a say - join the
  mailing list and get involved!</p>
